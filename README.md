# SQL Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates SQL-based analysis of sales data from a fictional retail company based in Australia. We'll get through various steps including exploration, cleaning and agreggation. We'll take some axis to frame our analysis and get some vizualisation.

## Datasets
- `customers.csv`: Contains customer information.
- `orders.csv`: Contains order transaction data.
- `products.csv`: Contains product details.
- `sales.csv`: Contains sales details over the analysis period.

## SQL Queries
The SQL queries used to analyze the data can be found in the `queries/` directory. They include:
- Basic queries to explore the data : primary & join keys checks, exploration steps...
- Advanced queries to perform joins and calculate aggregate metrics.

## Results
Key insights and visualizations can be found in the `results/` directory.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Load the `.csv` files into a SQLite database.
3. Run the SQL queries provided in the `queries/` directory.

## Future Work
Further analysis could include exploring customer lifetime value or predicting future sales trends.
